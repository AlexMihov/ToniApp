# ToniApp

##About
This is a project which was created in collaboration with Mattias Bush.


This App is a prototype which was built on Mattias' bachelor project for the [Zürcher Hochschule der Künste](https://www.zhdk.ch/).

To read more about his work, feel free to visit the website for this project, which provides a lot of insight into the workflow. The content is in German, including the videos [www.toniapp.ch](http://toniapp.ch/)

A current deployment of the app can be seen on [http://marktplatz.toniapp.ch](http://marktplatz.toniapp.ch).
Please be aware, that to view it properly, Chrome needs to be used to simulate an iPhone 5. Alternatively, the app can be visited with an iPhone 5, but needs to have a desktop shortcut, else the addressbar and the action bar will appear and hinder the experience.

##Installation guide
If you are interested in seeing the app locally, follow these steps:

* Install nodejs in your prefered fashion
* Install ionic and cordova using ```npm install -g cordova ionic```
* Install gulp ```npm install gulp```
* To make sure no packages are missing run ```npm install```
* From the terminal navigate into the Folder ```ToniApp/App/Toniapp``` and run ```ionic serve```

Your browser will now open localhost:8100 and you can enjoy the app there.
